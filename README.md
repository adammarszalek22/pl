# Premier League score guessing app

An app where a user can post their Premier League score predictions and compare it with others. There is a main league that contains all global users but small leagues can also be created (great for competing with friends and family!)

To run it, install kivy and kivymd first. You can also convert it to apk file and run it on android. Make sure that the url in main/api/db_api.py is :

url = "https://pl-server.onrender.com" and not url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000".
