# Premier League score predicting app

An app where a user can post their Premier League score predictions and compare it with others. There is a main league that contains all global users but small leagues can also be created (great for competing with friends and family!).

To run it, install kivy and kivymd first (also needs access to the server which is no longer live so you have run the 'pl-server' project locally). ~~Make sure that the url in main/api/db_api.py is: url = "https://pl-server.onrender.com" and not url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000".~~
